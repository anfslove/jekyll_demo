<h2>{{ page.title }}</h2>

I created an instance in Apache.When I go to the web app home page,
maybe it will say "You don't have permission to access on this server."
I usually find out the following words in Appache configuration file,to modify same as the words.
<br>
httpd-vhosts.conf
{% highlight xml %}
NameVirtualHost 115.28.183.202:80
<VirtualHost 115.28.183.202:80>
	DocumentRoot C:/Projects/dcxc
	ServerName 115.28.183.202
	ServerAlias 115.28.183.202
</VirtualHost>
{% endhighlight %}
