Maybe we can learn a lesson from MS. West.It's not just what you've got,but also how you package it.
Having the best ideas,the finest code,
or the most pragmatic[præɡ'mætɪk] thinking is ultimately['ʌltɪmətli] sterile['sterəl] unless you can communicate with other people.
a good idea is an orphan['ɔːrfn] without effective[ɪ'fektɪv] communication.

A large part of our day is spent communicating,

such as we spend hours in meetings and talking.
We work with end users,trying to understand their needs.
We write proposals[prə'pəʊzlz] and memos['memoʊ] requesting and justifying['dʒʌstɪfaɪɪŋ] resources,
reporting our status,and so on

so we need to do it well,but how?

1.Know What You Want To Say
	Plan what you want to say.
	Write an outline.
	Then ask your self,"Does this get across whatever I'm trying to say?",refine it until it does.

	This approach is not just applicable[ə'plɪkəbl] to writing documents.
	When you're faced with an important meeting or a phone call with a major['meɪdʒər] client,
	jot[dʒɑːt] down the ideas you want to communicate,and plan a couple of strategies['strætədʒi] for getting them across


2.Know Your Audience['ɔːdiəns]
	We can suggest a Web-based system to allow your end users to submit bug reports.
	We can present this system in many different ways,depending on your audience,like ZenDesk now we are using.
	End user will appreciate that they can submit bug reports 24 hours a day without waiting on the phone.
	By marking the appropriate pitch to each group,marketing,managers,developers,we'll get all excited about our project.

3.Choose Your Moment
	We usually don't make a call to our DHL client at Monday morning,because of they have a lot of meetings on Monday.
	If we have to ask them some questions,make what we're saying relevant['reləvənt] in time,as well as in content.
	so when we want to talk to someone,we should ask me first,Is this a good time to talk?

4.Be a Listener
	There's one technique that you must use if you want people to listen to you:listen to them.
	Even if this is a situation where you have all the information,
	even if this is a formal meeting with you standing in front of 20 suits.
	If you don't listen to them,they won't listen to you.
